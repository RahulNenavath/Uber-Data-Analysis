# Uber-Data-Analysis
Personal Uber Data Analysis

Downloaded my personal Uber Trips data by requesting Uber. Conducted Data Analysis and converted the latitute and longitute 
coordinates into hexagons using Uber's Geospatial Hexagonal Hierarchical Indexing libaray. These hexagons are plotted using 
the Folium libraby. Overall this exercise gives an proper understanding where all one has travelled to using an Uber 
and their expenditure.
